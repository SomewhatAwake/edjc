# EDJC (Elite Dangerous Jump Calculator) Configuration

# This plugin uses EDSM (Elite Dangerous Star Map) for system coordinates
# and calculates jump routes based on your ship's jump range.

# Get your API key from: https://www.edsm.net/en/settings/api
# This is mandatory for route calculations from your current location

[ship]
# Ship name/type (e.g., "Anaconda", "Asp Explorer", "DBX")
# This is for display purposes only - no API calls are made

# Laden jump range in light years (realistic range with cargo/fuel)
# IMPORTANT: Set this to YOUR actual ship's laden jump range
# Check this in-game in your ship's Systems panel or use a tool like EDSY or Coriolis
